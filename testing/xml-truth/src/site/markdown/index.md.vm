Introduction
============

This `xml-truth` module provides a [Google Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) extension to
compare XML data. It can be used as an alternative to [XMLUnit](http://www.xmlunit.org/). The basic
usage is as follows:

    assertAbout(xml()).that(actual).hasSameContentAs(expected);

This relies on the following static imports being present:

    import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertAbout;
    import static org.apache.axiom.truth.xml.XMLTruth.xml;

`actual` and `expected` are objects that represent XML data. The following types are currently
supported:

*   `InputStream`, `Reader`, `String` and `byte[]` with XML data to be parsed

*   `javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource` and `org.xml.sax.InputSource`

*   DOM `Document` or `Element` nodes

*   `java.net.URL`

*   `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`

By default, comparison is strict. E.g. the following assertion would fail:

    assertAbout(xml()).that("<p:a xmlns:p='urn:ns'/>").hasSameContentAs("<a xmlns='urn:ns'/>");

To control how the comparison is performed, use the relevant methods on the
[`XMLSubject`](apidocs/org/apache/axiom/truth/xml/XMLSubject.html) object returned by `that()`:
