/**
 * Provides instances for object model and meta factories.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getMetaFactory()} method returns the {@link OMMetaFactory} instance for the
 * default Axiom implementation. The {@link #getMetaFactory(String)} method locates a {@link
 * OMMetaFactory} instance for an Axiom implementation with a given feature. The following features
 * are predefined by the Axiom API:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link #FEATURE_DEFAULT}
 *   <dd>Identifies the default Axiom implementation. An implementation with that feature is
 *       expected to provide a full implementation of the Axiom API.
 *   <dt>{@link #FEATURE_DOM}
 *   <dd>Used by Axiom implementations that implement DOM in addition to the Axiom API.
 * </dl>
 *
 * Implementations may define other custom features.
 *
 * <p>Axiom discovers implementations by looking for {@code META-INF/axiom.xml} resources. They
 * specify the {@link OMMetaFactory} implementation as well as the set of features that each
 * implementation supports. If multiple implementations with the same feature are found, then Axiom
 * will select the one with the highest priority. The priority for a given feature is also declared
 * in {@code META-INF/axiom.xml}. This algorithm is used both in non OSGi and OSGi environments.
 *
 * <p>In a non OSGi environment, the default Axiom implementation can be overridden using the system
 * property specified by {@link #META_FACTORY_NAME_PROPERTY}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getOMFactory()}, {@link #getSOAP11Factory()} and {@link #getSOAP12Factory()}
 * methods return default instances for plain XML, SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 object model factories.
 * They are convenience methods calling {@link #getMetaFactory()} and then delegating to the
 * returned {@link OMMetaFactory}.
 *
 * <p>Note that while {@link #getMetaFactory()} always returns the same instance, the other methods
 * may return new instances on every invocation, depending on the {@link OMMetaFactory}
 * implementation.
