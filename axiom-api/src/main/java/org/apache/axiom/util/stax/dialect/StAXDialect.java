/**
 * Encapsulates the specific characteristics of a particular StAX implementation. In particular, an
 * implementation of this interface is able to wrap (if necessary) the readers and writers produced
 * by the StAX implementation to make them conform to the StAX specifications. This is called
 * <em>normalization</em>.
 *
 * <p>In addition to bugs in particular StAX implementations and clear violations of the StAX
 * specifications, the following ambiguities and gray areas in the specifications are also addressed
 * by the dialect implementations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The specifications don't tell whether it is allowed to use a <code>null</code> value for
 *       the charset encoding parameter in the following methods:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@link XMLOutputFactory#createXMLEventWriter(java.io.OutputStream, String)}
 *         <li>{@link XMLOutputFactory#createXMLStreamWriter(java.io.OutputStream, String)}
 *         <li>{@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#writeStartDocument(String, String)}
 *       </ul>
 *       Some implementations accept <code>null</code> values, while others throw an exception. To
 *       make sure that code written to run with a normalized {@link XMLOutputFactory} remains
 *       portable, the dialect implementation normalizes the behavior of these methods so that they
 *       consistently throw an exception when called with a <code>null</code> encoding. Note that
 *       the type of exception to be thrown remains unspecified.
 *   <li>The StAX specifications require that {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getEncoding()}
 *       returns the "input encoding if known or <code>null</code> if unknown". This requirement is
 *       not precise enough to guarantee consistent behavior across different implementations. In
 *       order to provide the consumer of the stream reader with complete and unambiguous
 *       information about the encoding of the underlying stream, the dialect implementations
 *       normalize the behavior of the {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getEncoding()} method
 *       such that it returns a non null value if and only if the reader was created from a byte
 *       stream, in which case the return value is the effective charset encoding used by the parser
 *       to decode the byte stream. According to the XML specifications, this value is determined by
 *       one of the following means:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>The encoding was provided when the stream reader was created, i.e. as a parameter to
 *             the {@link
 *             javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory#createXMLStreamReader(java.io.InputStream, String)}
 *             method. This is referred to as "external encoding information" by the XML
 *             specifications.
 *         <li>The encoding was specified by the XML encoding declaration.
 *         <li>The encoding was detected using the first four bytes of the stream, as described in
 *             appendix of the XML specifications.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>According to the table shown in the documentation of the {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader} class, calls to {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getEncoding()}, {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getVersion()}, {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#isStandalone()}, {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#standaloneSet()} and {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getCharacterEncodingScheme()} are only allowed in the
 *       {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamConstants#START_DOCUMENT} state. On the other hand, this
 *       requirement is not mentioned in the documentation of the individual methods and the
 *       majority of StAX implementations support calls to these methods in any state. However, to
 *       improve portability, the dialect implementations normalize these methods to throw an {@link
 *       IllegalStateException} if they are called in a state other than {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamConstants#START_DOCUMENT}.
 *   <li>The documentation of {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#isCharacters()} specifies that
 *       this method "returns true if the cursor points to a character data event". On the other
 *       hand, the documentation of {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader} states that "parsing
 *       events are defined as the XML Declaration, a DTD, start tag, character data, white space,
 *       end tag, comment, or processing instruction" and thus makes a clear distinction between
 *       character data events and white space events. This means that {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#isCharacters()} should return <code>true</code> if and
 *       only if the current event is {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamConstants#CHARACTERS}. This
 *       is the case for most parsers, but some return <code>true</code> for {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamConstants#SPACE} events as well. Where necessary, the dialect
 *       implementations correct this behavior.
 *   <li>It is not clear which methods other than {@link XMLStreamWriter#setPrefix(String, String)}
 *       and {@link XMLStreamWriter#setDefaultNamespace(String)} should update the namespace context
 *       maintained by the {@link XMLStreamWriter} when namespace repairing is disabled. In Woodstox
 *       and IBM's XL XP-J, only {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeNamespace(String, String)} and {@link
 *       XMLStreamWriter#writeDefaultNamespace(String)} do this. On the other hand, in BEA's
 *       reference implementation and in SJSXP, {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeStartElement(String,
 *       String, String)} also updates the namespace context (unless the given prefix is already
 *       bound to the namespace URI). The dialect implementations normalize the behavior such that
 *       only {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeNamespace(String, String)} and {@link
 *       XMLStreamWriter#writeDefaultNamespace(String)} update the namespace context.
 *       <p>Note that the statement about Woodstox doesn't apply to very old versions. Originally,
 *       Woodstox' {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeNamespace(String, String)} and {@link
 *       XMLStreamWriter#writeDefaultNamespace(String)} implementations didn't update the namespace
 *       context (as mentioned in <a href="http://markmail.org/message/olsdl3p3gciqqeob">this
 *       post</a> from 2006). This behavior <a
 *       href="http://markmail.org/thread/eoxprrkr2d2qoeqs">was changed in 2007</a>. Woodstox
 *       versions older than that are not supported.
 *       <p>Also note that as a corollary, if namespace repairing is disabled, it is mandatory to
 *       make the necessary calls to {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeNamespace(String, String)} and
 *       {@link XMLStreamWriter#writeDefaultNamespace(String)} in order to produce XML that is well
 *       formed with respect to namespaces, and it should therefore not be necessary to call {@link
 *       XMLStreamWriter#setPrefix(String, String)} or {@link
 *       XMLStreamWriter#setDefaultNamespace(String)} explicitly.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that there are several ambiguities in the StAX specification which are not addressed by
 * the different dialect implementations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It is not clear whether {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getAttributePrefix(int)}
 *       should return <code>null</code> or an empty string if the attribute doesn't have a prefix.
 *       Consistency with {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getPrefix()} would imply that it
 *       should return <code>null</code>, but some implementations return an empty string.
 *   <li>There is a contradicting in the documentation of the {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#next()} about the exception that is thrown when this
 *       method is called after {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#hasNext()} returns false. It
 *       can either be {@link IllegalStateException} or {@link java.util.NoSuchElementException}.
 *       <p>Note that some implementations (including the reference implementation) throw an {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException} in this case. This is considered as a violation of the
 *       specifications because this exception should only be used "if there is an error processing
 *       the underlying XML source", which is not the case.
 *   <li>An XML document may contain a namespace declaration such as {@code xmlns=""}. In this case,
 *       it is not clear if {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader#getNamespaceURI(int)} should
 *       return <code>null</code> or an empty string.
 *   <li>The documentation of {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#setPrefix(String, String)} and
 *       {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#setDefaultNamespace(String)} requires that the
 *       namespace "is bound in the scope of the current START_ELEMENT / END_ELEMENT pair". The
 *       meaning of this requirement is clear in the context of an element written using the <code>
 *       writeStartElement</code> and <code>writeEndElement</code> methods. On the other hand, the
 *       requirement is ambiguous in the context of an element written using <code>writeEmptyElement
 *       </code> and there are two competing interpretations:
 *       <ol>
 *         <li>Since the element is empty, it doesn't define a nested scope and the namespace should
 *             be bound in the scope of the enclosing element.
 *         <li>An invocation of one of the <code>writeEmptyElement</code> methods actually doesn't
 *             write a complete element because it can be followed by invocations of <code>
 *             writeAttribute</code>, <code>writeNamespace</code> or <code>writeDefaultNamespace
 *             </code>. The element is only completed by a call to a <code>write</code> method other
 *             than the aforementioned methods. An element written using <code>writeEmptyElement
 *             </code> therefore also defines a scope and the namespace should be bound in that
 *             scope.
 *       </ol>
 *       While the second interpretation seems to be more consistent, it would introduce another
 *       ambiguity for the following sequence of calls: <code>writeEmptyElement</code>, <code>
 *       writeAttribute</code>, <code>setPrefix</code>, <code>writeCharacters</code>. In this case,
 *       it is not clear if the scope of the empty element should end at the call to <code>
 *       writeAttribute</code> or <code>writeCharacters</code>.
 *       <p>Because of these ambiguities, the dialect implementations don't attempt to normalize the
 *       behavior of {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#setPrefix(String, String)} and {@link
 *       javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#setDefaultNamespace(String)} in this particular context,
 *       and their usage in conjunction with <code>writeEmptyElement</code> should be avoided.
 * </ul>
