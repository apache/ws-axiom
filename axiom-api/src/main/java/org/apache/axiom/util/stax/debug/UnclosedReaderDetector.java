 * reader will be detected when the {@link XMLStreamReader} instance is finalized by the virtual
 * machine. When this happens, a warning message will be logged. The log message contains the stack
 * trace of the instruction that created the reader.
 *
 * <p>Note that for this to work, the detector must compute the stack trace every time a reader is
 * created. Since this may have a significant performance impact, the wrapper should only used
 * during testing and debugging.
