/**
 * {@link Reader} implementation that extracts the text nodes from an element given by an {@link
 * XMLStreamReader}. The expected input is a document with only a document element (as produced by
 * {@link org.apache.axiom.om.OMElement#getXMLStreamReader()}). The class will extract the text
 * nodes that are direct children of that element, i.e. it uses the same conventions as {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.om.OMElement#getText()}. It will call {@link XMLStreamReader#close()} when the
 * end of the document is reached or when {@link #close()} is called.
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of this class is to provide a convenient and efficient way to get the text
 * content of an element without converting it first to a string, i.e. without using {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.om.OMElement#getText()}. This is important for potentially large contents, for
 * which this class guarantees constant memory usage.
 *
 * <p>Note that this class should in general not be used directly. Instead, {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.om.util.ElementHelper#getTextAsStream(org.apache.axiom.om.OMElement)} should be
 * called to get the most efficient stream implementation for a given an element.
