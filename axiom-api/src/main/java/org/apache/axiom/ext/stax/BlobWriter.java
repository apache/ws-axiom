/**
 * Extension interface for {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter} implementations that can receive
 * base64 encoded binary content as {@link Blob} objects. A stream writer implementing this
 * extension may write the binary data as base64 encoded character data or using some optimization
 * such as XOP/MTOM.
 *
 * <p>All the requirements specified in {@link org.apache.axiom.ext.stax} apply to this extension
 * interface. In particular, a consumer MUST use {@link
 * javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter#getProperty(String)} with the property name defined by {@link
 * #PROPERTY} to get a reference to this extension interface.
 *
 * <p>The interface defines two methods to write binary content, one that takes a {@link Blob}
 * argument and one with a {@link BlobProvider} argument. The first should be used when the content
 * is immediately available, while the second supports deferred loading of the data handler. The
 * meaning of the <code>contentID</code> and <code>optimize</code> arguments is the same for both
 * methods:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>contentID</code>
 *   <dd>A content ID of the binary content, if available. The semantics of this argument are
 *       similar to those defined for the return value of the {@link BlobReader#getContentID()}
 *       method:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>This argument should only be set if a content ID has been used previously in an
 *             interaction with another component or system. The caller SHOULD NOT generate a new
 *             content ID solely for the purpose of invoking the extension.
 *         <li>The argument must be a raw content ID.
 *         <li>The implementation MUST NOT make any assumption about the uniqueness or validity of
 *             the content ID. It MAY ignore the supplied value.
 *       </ul>
 *   <dt><code>optimize</code>
 *   <dd>Specifies if binary content is eligible for optimization (e.g. using XOP) or if it should
 *       be serialized as base64. This is only an indication and the implementation MAY choose to
 *       override this value or ignore it entirely.
 * </dl>
 *
 * Instead of interacting directly with this extension interface, the consumer may use the {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.util.stax.XMLStreamWriterUtils#writeBlob(javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter, Blob,
 * String, boolean)} or {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.util.stax.XMLStreamWriterUtils#writeBlob(javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter,
 * BlobProvider, String, boolean)} utility methods. These methods make the processing of binary data
 * entirely transparent for the caller.
