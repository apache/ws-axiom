/**
 * Interface implemented by {@link XMLStreamReader} classes that delegate to another stream reader
 * and that can be safely unwrapped.
 *
 * <p>This interface gives access to the parent reader, i.e. it allows to unwrap a stream reader
 * wrapper. It should be noted that in general, unwrapping a wrapper and accessing the parent object
 * is not a safe operation because it may invalidate the state of the wrapper (which may still be
 * used later). Therefore this interface must only be implemented by {@link XMLStreamReader} classes
 * for which unwrapping is a safe operation. In particular, this interface should not be implemented
 * by wrappers that alter the sequence of events produced by the stream reader.
 *
 * <p>This interface is used by {@link
 * org.apache.axiom.util.stax.XMLStreamReaderUtils#getOriginalXMLStreamReader(XMLStreamReader)} to
 * get access to the original parser.
 *
 * @deprecated
