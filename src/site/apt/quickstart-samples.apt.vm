Adding Axiom as a Maven dependency

  To use Axiom in a project built using Maven, add the following dependencies:

+------------------------------------------------+
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ws.commons.axiom</groupId>
    <artifactId>axiom-api</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ws.commons.axiom</groupId>
    <artifactId>axiom-impl</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
+------------------------------------------------+

  Note that the <<<axiom-impl>>> dependency is added in scope <<<runtime>>>
  because application code should not refer to implementation classes directly.
  All Axiom features are accessible through the public API which is provided
  by <<<axiom-api>>>.
  
  If the application code requires a DOM compliant Axiom implementation,
  then the following dependency needs to be added too:

+------------------------------------------------+
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ws.commons.axiom</groupId>
    <artifactId>axiom-dom</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
+------------------------------------------------+

Parsing and processing an XML document

  The following sample shows how to parse and process an XML document using Axiom.
  It is pretty much self-explaining:

%{snippet|id=main|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/ParseSample.java}

Schema validation using javax.xml.validation

  This sample demonstrates how to validate a part of an Axiom tree (actually the body of a SOAP message)
  using the <<<javax.xml.validation>>> API:

%{snippet|id=sax|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/ValidateSample.java}

  It leverages the fact that Axiom is capable of constructing a <<<SAXSource>>> from an <<<OMDocument>>>
  or <<<OMElement>>>.

  Alternatively, one can use a DOM compliant Axiom implementation and use a
  <<<DOMSource>>> to pass the XML fragment to the validator:

%{snippet|id=dom|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/ValidateSample.java}

Loading local chunks from a large XML document

  Here the goal is to process a large XML document "by chunks", i.e.
  
    [[1]] Parse the file and find a relevant element (e.g. by name)
    
    [[2]] Load this element into memory as an <<<OMElement>>>.
    
    [[3]] Process the <<<OMElement>>> (the "chunk").
  
  The process is repeated until the end of the document is reached.
  
  This can be achieved without loading the entire document into memory (and without loading all the
  chunks in memory) by scanning the document using the StAX API and switching to Axiom when a
  matching element is found:

%{snippet|id=main|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/FragmentsSample.java}

  The code leverages the fact that <<<createStAXOMBuilder>>> can be used to build a fragment
  (corresponding to a given element) from a StAX stream reader, simply by passing an
  <<<XMLStreamReader>>> that is positioned on a <<<START_ELEMENT>>> event.

Processing MTOM messages

  This sample shows how to process MTOM messages with Axiom. The code actually sends a request to
  the following JAX-WS service:

%{snippet|id=class|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/MTOMService.java}

  It then extracts the binary content from the response and writes it to a given <<<OutputStream>>>:

%{snippet|id=retrieveContent|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/MTOMSample.java}

  The sample code shows that in order to parse an MTOM message one first needs to construct an
  <<<Attachments>>> object that is then passed to the relevant method in <<<OMXMLBuilderFactory>>>.
  In the object model, an XOP/MTOM attachment is represented as an <<<OMText>>> node for which <<<isBinary()>>> returns
  <<<true>>>. Such a node is created for each <<<xop:Include>>> element in the original message.
  The binary data is stored in a <<<DataHandler>>> object that can be obtained by a call to the
  <<<getDataHandler()>>> method of the <<<OMText>>> node.
  
  By default attachments are loaded into memory, but the constructors of the <<<Attachments>>> class
  allow to configure caching on disk. The sample actually shows an alternative method to reduce the
  memory footprint of the MTOM processing, which is to enable streaming. This is supported starting
  with Axiom 1.2.13.

Logging MTOM messages without inlining optimized binary data

  A common way to log a SOAP message is to invoke the <<<toString>>> method on the corresponding <<<SOAPEnvelope>>>
  object and send the result to the logger. However, this is problematic for MTOM messages because the
  <<<toString>>> method will always serialize the message as plain XML and therefore inline optimized
  binary data using base64 encoding.
  
  Except for this particular use case, serializing a message using MTOM without actually producing
  the MIME parts for the binary data is not meaningful and is therefore not directly supported by
  the Axiom API. However the following simple trick can be used to implement this:

%{snippet|id=variant1|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/MTOMLogSample.java}
  
  It relies on the <<<XOPEncodingStreamWriter>>> class which is used by Axiom internally to perform the
  XOP/MTOM encoding. This class is implemented as an <<<XMLStreamWriter>>> wrapper and is responsible for
  generating the <<<xop:Include>>> elements. It also builds a map of the MIME parts that need to be generated.
  Since <<<XOPEncodingStreamWriter>>> is an <<<XMLStreamWriter>>> proxy, it can easily be used in conjunction with the
  <<<serialize(XMLStreamWriter)>>> method and an <<<XMLStreamWriter>>> that writes the result to
  a <<<StringWriter>>>. The trick here is to only store the SOAP part and to disregard the MIME parts
  for the attachments. Since <<<XOPEncodingStreamWriter>>> only stores references to the <<<DataHandler>>>
  objects for these attachements, there is no overhead associated with that.
  
  One may wonder how <<<XOPEncodingStreamWriter>>> can receive <<<DataHandler>>> objects considering that
  it is an <<<XMLStreamWriter>>> implementation and that the StAX API doesn't know anything about XOP/MTOM or
  <<<DataHandler>>> objects. The answer is that <<<XOPEncodingStreamWriter>>> actually implements an Axiom
  specific extension defined by the <<<DataHandlerWriter>>> interface. An alternative solution for the logging
  problem is therefore to use a custom <<<XMLStreamWriter>>> implementation that supports that extension and
  that bypasses the serialization of the <<<DataHandler>>> objects, e.g. by replacing them by some
  placeholder text:

%{snippet|id=main|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/LogWriter.java}

  The following code shows how this class would be used to log the MTOM message:

%{snippet|id=variant2|file=modules/axiom-samples/src/test/java/org/apache/axiom/samples/MTOMLogSample.java}
