Apache Axiom 2.0.0 Release Note
===============================

Axiom 2 introduces breaking changes to remove the dependency of `axiom-api` on classes in the
`javax.activation` package, in particular `DataHandler`:

- Some classes that depend on `javax.activation` have been moved into a separate `axiom-javax-activation`
  JAR. In some cases the package name has also been changed to avoid split packages. If you
  encounter a missing class during migration, check whether that class exists in `axiom-javax-activation`
  and update dependencies and package names as needed.

- The legacy `Attachments` API has been moved into a separate `axiom-legacy-attachments` JAR. This
  API is still used by Axis2, but new code should use `MultipartBody` instead. The (previously
  deprecated) methods in `OMXMLBuilderFactory` that refer to `Attachments` have been removed. To
  continue using the `Attachments` class, call the `getMultipartBody` method and pass the result to
  `OMXMLBuilderFactory`.

- Because of these changes the XOP/MTOM serializer no longer infers the content type and content
  transfer encoding of non-root parts from (`Blob` wrapped) `DataHandler` objects linked to `OMText`
  nodes by default. This behavior now needs to be enabled explicitly by setting the
  `ContentTypeProvider` and `ContentTransferEncodingPolicy` on the `OMOutputFormat` to
  `DataHandlerContentTypeProvider.INSTANCE` and `ConfigurableDataHandler.CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING_POLICY`
  respectively.

- APIs that have been updated to remove the dependency on `DataHandler` have also been changed to
  make use of `ContentType` instead of `String` where this is relevant.
