                command:

            <title>Testing</title>
            <section>
                <title>Unit test organization</title>
                <para>
                    Historically, all unit tests were placed in the <filename>axiom-tests</filename> project.
                    One specific problem with this is that since all tests are in a common Maven module
                    which depends on both <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and <filename>axiom-dom</filename>,
                    it is not rare to see DOOM tests that accidentally use the LLOM implementation (which is the default).
                    The project description in <filename>axiom-tests/pom.xml</filename> indicates that it
                    was the intention to split the <filename>axiom-tests</filename> project into several parts
                    and make them part of <filename>axiom-api</filename>, <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and
                    <filename>axiom-dom</filename>. This reorganization is not complete
                    yet<footnote><para>See <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-311">AXIOM-311</link>.</para></footnote>.
                    For new test cases (or when refactoring existing tests), the following guidelines should be applied:
                </para>
                <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Tests that validate the code in <filename>axiom-api</filename> and that do not require
                            an Axiom implementation to execute should be placed in <filename>axiom-api</filename>.
                            This primarily applies to tests that validate utility classes in <filename>axiom-api</filename>.
                        </para>

                            The code of unit tests that apply to all Axiom implementations and that check conformance
                            to the specifications of the Axiom API should be added
                            to <filename>axiom-api</filename> and executed in <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and
                            <filename>axiom-dom</filename>. Currently, the recommended way is to create a
                            base class in <filename>axiom-api</filename> (with suffix <classname>TestBase</classname>) and
                            to create subclasses in <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and <filename>axiom-dom</filename>.
                            This makes sure that the DOOM tests never accidentally use LLOM (because
                            <filename>axiom-impl</filename> is not a dependency of <filename>axiom-dom</filename>).

                <title>Consistent serialization</title>
                <para>
                    Axiom supports multiple methods and APIs to serialize an object model to XML or to transform it
                    to another (non Axiom) representation. This includes serialization to byte or character streams, transformation
                    to StAX in push mode (i.e. writing to an <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname>) or pull mode
                    (i.e. reading from an <classname>XMLStreamReader</classname>), as well as transformation to SAX.
                    The representations produced by these different methods should be consistent with each other.
                    If a given use case can be implemented using more than one of these methods, then the end result
                    should be the same, whichever method is chosen.
                </para>

                where this principle was not respected.
            </para>
            <para>
                It should be noted that this principle can obviously only be respected within the limits imposed
                by a given API. E.g. if a given API has limited support for DTDs, then a <tag class="element">DOCTYPE</tag>
                declaration may be skipped when that API is used.

                            OSGi support was originally introduced in Axiom 1.2.9, but the implementation had
                            a couple of flaws. This section discusses the rationale behind the new OSGi
                            support introduced in Axiom 1.2.13.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Axiom is designed as a set of abstract APIs for which two implementations are
                            provided: LLOM and DOOM. It is important to make a clear distinction between what
                            is part of the public API and what should be considered implementation classes that
                            must not be used by application code directly. This also implies that Axiom must
                            provide the necessary APIs to allow application code to access all features without
                            the need to access implementation classes directly. This section in particular
                            discusses the question how application code can request factories that support DOM
                            without the need to refer directly to DOOM.
                        </para>

                </itemizedlist>
                <para>
                    These two questions are closely related because OSGi allows to enforce the distinction
                    between public API and implementation classes by carefully selecting the packages
                    exported by the different bundles: only classes belonging to the public API
                    should be exported, while implementation classes should be private to the bundles
                    containing them. This in turn has implications for the packaging of these artifacts.

                        The alternative would be to produce two sets of artifacts during the build. This
                        should be avoided in order to keep the build process as simple as possible.
                        It should also be noted that the Geronimo Spec artifacts also meet this requirement.

                        This requirement was already satisfied by the OSGi support introduced in Axiom 1.2.9.
                        It therefore also ensures that the transition to the new OSGi support in Axiom 1.2.13
                        is transparent for applications that already use Axiom in an OSGi container.

                        Only classes belonging to the public API should be exported by the OSGi bundles.
                        Implementation classes should not be exported. In particular,
                        the bundles for the LLOM and DOOM implementations MUST NOT export any packages.
                        This is required to keep a clean separation between the public API and implementation
                        specific classes and to make sure that the implementations can be modified without the
                        risk of breaking existing code.
                        An exception MAY be made for factory classes related to foreign APIs, such as the
                        <classname>DocumentBuilderFactory</classname> implementation for an Axiom implementation
                        supporting DOM.

                        Axiom is designed around an abstract API and allows for the existence of multiple
                        independent implementations. A factory (<classname>OMAbstractFactory</classname>) is used to
                        locate and instantiate the desired implementation. This is similar to APIs such as
                        JAXP (<classname>DocumentBuilderFactory</classname>, etc.) and JAXB (<classname>JAXBContext</classname>).
                        These APIs have been successfully "OSGi-fied" e.g. by the Apache Geronimo project.
                        Instead of reinventing the wheel, we should leverage that work and adapt it to
                        Axiom's specific requirements.

                        It should be noted that because of the way the Axiom API is designed and taking into account
                        <xref linkend="osgi-req-same-api"/>, it is not possible to make Axiom entirely compatible
                        with OSGi paradigms (the same is true for JAXB). In an OSGi-only world, each Axiom
                        implementation would simply expose itself as an OSGi service (of type <classname>OMMetaFactory</classname> e.g.)
                        and code depending on Axiom would bind to one (or more) of these services depending on its needs.
                        That is not possible because it would conflict with <xref linkend="osgi-req-same-api"/>.

                        APIs such as JAXP and JAXB have been designed from the start for inclusion into the JRE.
                        They need to support scenarios where an application bundles its own implementation
                        (e.g. an application may package a version of Apache Xerces, which would then be

                        <classname>DocumentBuilderFactory</classname>). That implies that the selected implementation
                        depends on the thread context class loader. It is assumed that there is no such requirement
                        for Axiom, which means that in a non OSGi environment, the Axiom implementations are always loaded from the same
                        class loader as the <literal>axiom-api</literal> JAR.

                            the SPI implementation, without ever loading any OSGi specific class. On the other hand,
                            in an OSGi environment, it will query the registry maintained by the registry bundle to locate
                            the provider. The reference to the registry is injected into the <classname>ProviderLocator</classname>
                            class using a bundle activator.

                    Obviously, Axiom could reuse the registry and locator bundles developed by Geronimo. This however would
                    contradict <xref linkend="osgi-reg-no-framework"/>. In addition, for Axiom there is no requirement to
                    strictly follow the JDK 1.3 service discovery algorithm. Therefore Axiom should reuse the pattern
                    developed by Geronimo, but not the actual implementation.

                <para>
                    Application code rarely uses DOOM as the default Axiom implementation. Several downstream projects
                    (e.g. the Axis2/Rampart combination) use both the default (LLOM) implementation and DOOM. They select
                    the implementation based on the particular context. As of Axiom 1.2.12, the only way to create an object
                    model instance with the DOOM implementation is to use the <classname>DOOMAbstractFactory</classname> API
                    or to instantiate one of the factory classes (<classname>OMDOMMetaFactory</classname>, <classname>OMDOMFactory</classname>
                    or one of the subclasses of <classname>DOMSOAPFactory</classname>). All these classes are part of
                    the <literal>axiom-dom</literal> artifact. This is clearly in contradiction with <xref linkend="osgi-ref-impl-not-exported"/>
                    and <xref linkend="osgi-req-dropin"/>.
                </para>
                <para>
                    To overcome this problem the Axiom API must be enhanced to make it possible to select an Axiom
                    implementation based on capabilities/features requested by the application code. E.g. in the case
                    of DOOM, the application code would request a factory that implements the DOM API. It is then up
                    to the Axiom API classes to locate an appropriate implementation, which may be DOOM or another
                    drop-in replacement, as per <xref linkend="osgi-req-dropin"/>.
                </para>

                    If multiple Axiom implementations are available (on the class path in non OSGi environment or
                    deployed as bundles in an OSGi environment), then the Axiom API must also be able to select an
                    appropriate default implementation if no specific feature is requested by the application code.
                    This can be easily implemented by defining a special feature called "default" that would be
                    declared by any Axiom implementation that is suitable as a default implementation.
                </para>

                    <para>
                        DOOM is generally not considered suitable as a default implementation because it doesn't
                        implement the complete Axiom API (e.g. it doesn't support <classname>OMSourcedElement</classname>).
                        In addition, in earlier versions of Axiom, the factory classes for DOOM were not stateless
                        (see <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-412">AXIOM-412</link>).

                <para>
                    Finally, to make the selection algorithm deterministic, there should also be a concept
                    of priority: if multiple Axiom implementations are found for the same feature, then the Axiom API
                    would select the one with the highest priority.

                            The relevant Axiom APIs are enhanced so that they take an optional argument

                            is requested, then Axiom will use the <literal>default</literal> feature.

                            To determine the <classname>OMMetaFactory</classname> to be used, Axiom locates
                            the implementations declaring the requested feature and selects the one that
                            has the highest priority for that feature.

                    A remaining question is how the implementation declares the feature/priority information.
                    There are two options:
                </para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Add a method to <classname>OMMetaFactory</classname> that allows the Axiom API
                            to query the feature/priority information from the implementation (i.e. the
                            features and priorities are hardcoded in the implementation).
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Let the implementation provide this information declaratively in its metadata
                            (either in the manifest or in a separate resource with a well defined name).
                            Note that in a non OSGi environment, such a metadata resource must be used anyway
                            to enable the Axiom API to locate the <classname>OMMetaFactory</classname> implementations.
                            Therefore this would be a natural place to declare the features as well.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                <para>
                    The second option has the advantage to make it easier for users to debug and tweak
                    the implementation discovery process (e.g. there may be a need to
                    customize the features and priorities declared by the different implementations to ensure
                    that the right implementation is chosen in a particular use case).
                </para>
                <para>
                    This leads to the following design decision:
                    the features and priorities (together with the class name of the <classname>OMMetaFactory</classname>
                    implementation) will be defined in an XML descriptor with resource name <filename>META-INF/axiom.xml</filename>.
                    The format of that descriptor must take into account that a single JAR may contain several
                    Axiom implementations (e.g. if the JAR is an uber-JAR repackaged from the standard Axiom JARs).

                <para>
                    Obviously the LLOM and DOOM implementations share some amount of common code. Historically,
                    implementation classes reusable between LLOM and DOOM were placed in <literal>axiom-api</literal>.
                    This however tends to blur the distinction between the public API and implementation classes.
                    Starting with Axiom 1.2.13 such classes are placed into a separate module called
                    <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal>. However, <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal> cannot simply
                    be a dependency of <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal>.
                    The reason is that in an OSGi environment, the <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal> bundle
                    would have to export these shared classes, which is in contradiction with <xref linkend="osgi-ref-impl-not-exported"/>.
                    Therefore the code from <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal> needs to be packaged into
                    <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> by the build process so that
                    the <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal> artifact is not required at runtime.
                    <xref linkend="osgi-req-no-separate-bundles"/> forbids using embedded JARs to achieve this.
                    Instead <literal>maven-shade-plugin</literal> is used to include the classes
                    from <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal> into <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal>
                    (and to modify the POMs to remove the dependencies on <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal>).
                </para>
                <para>
                    This raises the question whether <literal>maven-shade-plugin</literal> should be configured to
                    simply copy the classes or to relocate them (i.e. to change their package names). There are a couple
                    of arguments in favor of relocating them:
                </para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            According to <xref linkend="osgi-req-no-separate-bundles"/>, the Axiom artifacts should be
                            usable both as normal JARs and as OSGi bundles. Obviously the expectation is that from the
                            point of view of application code, they should work in the same in OSGi and non OSGi environments.
                            Relocation is required if one wants to strictly satisfy this requirement even if different versions
                            of <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> are mixed.
                            Since the container creates separate class loaders for the <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> bundles,
                            it is always possible to do that in an OSGi environment: even if the shared classes
                            included in <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> are
                            not relocated, but have the same names, this will not result in conflicts.
                            The situation is different in a non OSGi environment where the classes in <literal>axiom-impl</literal>
                            and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> are loaded by the same class loader. If the shared classes
                            are not relocated, then there may be a conflict if the versions don't match.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            However, in practice it is unlikely that there are valid use case where one would use
                            <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> artifacts from different Axiom versions.

                            Relocation allows to preserve compatibility when duplicate code from
                            <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> is merged and moved
                            to <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal>. The <classname>OMNamespaceImpl</classname>,
                            <classname>OMNavigator</classname> and <classname>OMStAXWrapper</classname> classes
                            from <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and the <classname>NamespaceImpl</classname>,
                            <classname>DOMNavigator</classname> and <classname>DOMStAXWrapper</classname>
                            classes from <literal>axiom-dom</literal> that existed in earlier versions of Axiom
                            are examples of this. The classes in <literal>axiom-dom</literal> were almost identical
                            to the corresponding classes in <literal>axiom-impl</literal>. These classes have been
                            merged and moved to <literal>axiom-common-impl</literal>. Relocation then allows them
                            to retain their original name (including the original package name) in the
                            <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> artifacts.

                            However, this is only a concern if one wants to preserve compatibility with existing
                            code that directly uses these implementation specific classes (which is something that is
                            strongly discouraged). One example where this was relevant was the SAAJ implementation
                            in Axis2 which used to be very strongly coupled to the DOOM implementation. This however
                            has been fixed now.

                            Axiom now uses JaCoCo to produce code coverage reports. However these reports are
                            incomplete if relocation is used. This doesn't affect test cases executed in
                            the <literal>axiom-impl</literal> and <literal>axiom-dom</literal> modules
                            (because they are executed with the original classes), but tests in separate modules
                            (such as integration tests). There are actually two issues:

                                    For the relocated classes, JaCoCo is unable to find the corresponding source code.
                                    This means that the reported code coverage is inaccurate for classes in

            <para>
                The <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> API is used by the MIME handling code in Axiom
                to manage the temporary files that are used to buffer the content of attachment parts.
                The <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> implementation is responsible to track the temorary
                files that have been created and to ensure that they are deleted when they are no longer used.
                In Axiom 1.2.x, this API has multiple issues and a redesign is required for Axiom 1.3.

                            One of the stated design goals (see <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-192">AXIOM-192</link>)
                            of the <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> API was to wrap the files in <classname>FileAccessor</classname> objects to

                            causes a class loader leak in J2EE environments.

                            introduced another class called <classname>AttachmentCacheMonitor</classname> that implements a timer
                            based mechanism to clean up temporary files. However, this change causes other issues:

                                    The existence of this API has a negative impact on Axiom's architectural integrity because it
                                    has functionality that overlaps with <classname>LifecycleManager</classname>. This means that
                                    we now have two completely separate APIs that are expected to serve the same purpose, but
                                    none of them addresses the problem properly.

                                    way to stop that timer. This means that this API can only be used if Axiom is integrated
                                    into the container, but not when it is deployed with an application.

                            and once the <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> API is redesigned to solve that issue,

                <title>Cleanup strategy for temporary files</title>
                <para>
                    As pointed out in the previous section, one of the primary problems with the
                    <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> API in Axiom 1.2.x is that temporary files that are
                    not cleaned up explicitly by application code (e.g. using the <methodname>purgeDataSource</methodname> method
                    defined by <classname>DataHandlerExt</classname>) are only removed when the JVM exits.
                    A timer based strategy that deletes temporary file after a given time interval (as proposed
                    by <classname>AttachmentCacheMonitor</classname>) is not reliable
                    because in some use cases, application code may keep a reference to the attachment part for
                    a long time before accessing it again.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The only reliable strategy is to take advantage of finalization, i.e. to rely on the garbage
                    collector to trigger the deletion of temporary files that are no longer used. For this to work
                    the design of the API (and its default implementation) must satisfy the following two conditions:
                </para>
                <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            All access to the underlying file must be strictly encapsulated, so that the file
                            is only accessible as long as there is a strong reference to the object that
                            encapsulates the file access. This is necessary to ensure that the file can
                            be safely deleted once there is no longer a strong reference and the
                            object is garbage collected.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Java guarantees that the finalizer is invoked before the instance is garbage
                            collected. However, instances are not necessarily garbage collected before the
                            JVM exits, and in that case the finalizer is never invoked. Therefore, the
                            implementation must delete all existing temporary files when the JVM exits.
                            The API design should also take into account that some implementations of
                            the <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> API may want to trigger this
                            cleanup before the JVM exits, e.g. when the J2EE application in which
                            Axiom is deployed is stopped.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist>
                <para>
                    The first condition can be satisfied by redesigning the <classname>FileAccessor</classname>
                    such that it never leaks the name of the file it represents (neither as a <classname>String</classname>
                    nor a <classname>File</classname> object). This in turn means that the
                    <classname>CachedFileDataSource</classname> class must be removed from the Axiom API.
                    In addition, the <methodname>getInputStream</methodname> method defined by
                    <classname>FileAccessor</classname> must no longer return a simple <classname>FileInputStream</classname>
                    instance, but must use a wrapper that keeps a strong reference to the <classname>FileAccessor</classname>,
                    so that the <classname>FileAccessor</classname> can't be garbage collected while the
                    input stream is still in use.
                </para>
                <para>
                    To satisfy the second condition, one may want to use <methodname>File#deleteOnExit</methodname>.
                    However, this method causes a native memory leak, especially when used with temporary files,
                    which are expected to have unique names (see
                    <link xlink:href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4513817">bug 4513817</link>).
                    Therefore this can only be implemented using a shutdown hook. However, a shutdown hook will
                    cause a class loader leak if it is used improperly, e.g. if it is registered by an application deployed
                    into a J2EE container and not unregistered when that application is stopped. For this
                    particular case, it is possible to create a special <classname>LifecycleManager</classname>
                    implementation, but for this to work, the lifecycle of this type of <classname>LifecycleManager</classname>
                    must be bound to the lifecycle of the application, e.g. using a
                    <classname>ServletContextListener</classname>. This is not always possible and this approach
                    is therefore not suitable for the default <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> implementation.
                </para>
                <para>
                    To avoid the class loader leak, the default <classname>LifecycleManager</classname> implementation
                    should register the shutdown hook when the first temporary file is registered and
                    automatically unregister the shutdown hook again when there are no more temporary files.
                    This implies that the shutdown hook is repeatedly registered and unregistered. However, since
                    these are relatively cheap operations<footnote><para>Since the JRE typically uses an
                    <classname>IdentityHashMap</classname> to store shutdown hooks, the only overhead is caused
                    by Java 2 security checks and synchronization.</para></footnote>, this should not be a concern.
                </para>
                <para>
                    An additional complication is that when the shutdown hook is executed, the temporary files
                    may still be in use. This contrasts with the finalizer case where encapsulation guarantees
                    that the file is no longer in use. This situation doesn't cause an issue on Unix platforms (where it is possible
                    to delete a file while it is still open), but needs to be handled properly on Windows.
                    This can only be achieved if the <classname>FileAccessor</classname> keeps track of
                    created streams, so that it can forcibly close the underlying <classname>FileInputStream</classname> objects.

                    Apache Axiom is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand building
                    of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
                    building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built in support for
                    XML Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary
                    data efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use API
                    with a very high performant architecture!

                <para>
                    Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache Axiom is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a
                    pure standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.
