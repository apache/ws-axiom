     Apache AXIOM 1.2.10 Release Note

===========================================

  Axiom 1.2.10 is a maintenance release that contains the following improvements:
  
    * Improved DOM compatibility and performance for DOOM. Users running Rampart on Axis2 1.5.2
      may want to upgrade Axiom to 1.2.10 to take advantage of these improvements.
    
    * Improved interoperability with various StAX implementation, in particular
      support for Woodstox 4.0.
    
    * It is now possible to specify a configuration when requesting an XMLStreamWriter
      from StAXUtils, similarly to what is already possible for XMLStreamReader instances.
      This feature is required to support the next Abdera release (see ABDERA-267).
