     Apache Axiom 1.2.14 Release Note

===========================================

  Axiom 1.2.14 contains fixes for more than twenty JIRA issues [1] as well as lots of other
  improvements.
  
  Users upgrading to 1.2.14 should take into account the following changes:
  
    * Axiom now uses Woodstox 4.1.x as StAX implementation (although 3.2.x and 4.0.x are still
      supported).
    
    * OMFactory implementations for DOOM are now stateless.
    
    * Several deprecated classes have been moved to a new JAR file named axiom-compat and are no
      longer included in the core artifacts (axiom-api, axiom-impl and axiom-dom).
  
  For more information about the possible impact on existing application code of these changes,
  please refer to the user guide.
