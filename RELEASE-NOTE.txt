     Apache AXIOM 1.2.2 Release Note

===========================================

Apache AXIOM is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports 
on-demand building of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model 
which allows one to turn off the tree building and directly access the underlying
pull event stream. It also has built-in support for XML Optimized Packaging (XOP)
and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data efficiently 
and in a transparent manner. The combination of these results in a easy to use 
API with a very high performant architecture!

Initialy developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache AXIOM (AXIs Object Model) is 
the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a pure standalone XML Infoset model with
novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.
