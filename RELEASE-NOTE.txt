     Apache AXIOM 1.2.9 Release Note

===========================================

Note: Starting with release 1.2.9, Axiom requires Java 1.5. While the API is
still compatible with Java 1.4, Axiom relies on classes from the Java 1.5
runtime environment. Some of its dependencies also require Java 1.5.

What's New in This Release

  Highlights in this release:
  
    * Improved interoperability with StAX implementations other than Woodstox. Axiom now
      detects the StAX implementation that is used and works around interoperability issues.
      In particular, version 1.2.9 solves the longstanding concurrency issue that occurs
      when using Axiom with SJSXP.

    * Better control over XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory settings. It is now possible
      to use property files to define application wide default settings for the StAX factories
      used by StAXUtils. It is also possible to specify a particular configuration when
      requesting a StAX parser from StAXUtils.

    * Improved XOP/MTOM handling. Axiom 1.2.9 is able to stream binary/base64 data in several
      situations where this was not possible previously. The behavior of Axiom 1.2.9 is also
      more consistent with respect to XOP encoded data sent to the application, solving
      some issues where attachments were processed incorrectly.
	
    * Improved documentation. There is now more and better Javadoc. Also, a user guide
      is available in HTML and as PDF.
    
    * Better OSGi support.
    
    * Improved consistency of the core interfaces. E.g. OMDocument now has a build
      method.
